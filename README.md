## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- CSS custom properties
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project really challenged my Javascript knowledge. Luckily I was able to find the resources linked below that helped me further understand some of the things I was struggling with.

### Continued development

I really wanted to use React with this project, but am not comfortable enough with it yet so I stuck to HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. I plan on continuing to improve my React skills and knowledge so I can feel more confident to use it on future projects.

### Useful resources

- [How to Make a Password Strength Checker](https://youtu.be/2_4tEdyNfO0) - This YouTube video by CodingLab helped me understand some of the javascript functionality behind checking the strength of a generated password.
- [Building a Password Generator with JavaScript](https://www.studytonight.com/post/building-a-password-generator-with-javascript) - This is a great article which helped me understand some of the JavaScript functionality behind generating a random password. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
